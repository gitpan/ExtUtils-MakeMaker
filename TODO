Fix INSTALLMAN*DIR to honor PREFIX.

Make the libs honor PREFIX.

Add SITEPREFIX

Fix prefixify to use $(PREFIX) instead of cut & pasting the prefix
directly into the Makefile.

Add INSTALLDIRS=vendor (see Debian patch)

pm_to_blib).

Cleanup manifypods so it uses Pod::Man instead of pod2man.

Investigate one method per make target.

Test MM_Any and pull some redundant tests out of MM_*.t

MakeMaker's warnhandler has to go away.

Create a way to init MM objects.

(ie. PREFIX=/usr, INSTALLCONFIGDIR=/etc).
