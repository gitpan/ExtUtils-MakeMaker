Create a way to init MM objects.

Move instmodsh to utils/ in the core.

Document prompt()

MakeMaker's warnhandler has to go away.

Fix INSTALLMAN*DIR to honor PREFIX.

Fix prefixify to use $(PREFIX) instead of cut & pasting the prefix
directly into the Makefile.

Make the libs honor PREFIX.

Don't assume everything is in $Config{PREFIX}/lib and
$Config{PREFIX}/man.  Debian puts stuff in /usr/share/{perl,man}

Investigate one method per make target.

Handle config files (ie. /etc) and their special PREFIX needs
(ie. PREFIX=/usr, INSTALLCONFIGDIR=/etc).

Add SITEPREFIX

Add INSTALLDIRS=vendor (see Debian patch)

Shorten manifypods so it fits in < 200 character command line (like
pm_to_blib).

Cleanup manifypods so it uses Pod::Man instead of pod2man.

Rethink MM_Win32 tests.

Test MM_Any and pull some redundant tests out of MM_*.t
