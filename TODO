Rethink MM_Win32 tests.

Investigate one method per make target.

Test MM_Any and pull some redundant tests out of MM_*.t

Create a way to init MM objects.  (XXX What's wrong with MakeMaker->new?)

Move instmodsh to utils/ in the core.

Handle config files (ie. /etc) and their special PREFIX needs
(ie. PREFIX=/usr, INSTALLCONFIGDIR=/etc).

Make sure PDL builds

Fix find_perl on Amiga trg@privat.utfors.se

Fix appending of .. when DIRS contains directories not immediately
below the cwd.

Fill in the IMPORTS docs.

Document "make install UNINST=1"

Remove tar -I Sun-ism from instmodsh.

Consider adding a timeout option to prompt() and env variable.

Remove the dogmatic "always use h2xs" from the docs and replace with
something a bit more sensible.  References to ModuleMaker and perhaps
a small Makefile.PL tutorial.

Unify VMS->find_perl

Consider if VMS->find_perl needs to have pieces put into maybe_command()

Consider if shell escaping all macro data is a good idea.

Have 'make distdir' spit out a META.yml file.

Move Win32->init_others() ExtUtils::Command overrides into MM_Any.

Figure out and document the 4th arg to ExtUtils::Install::install()

Consider if adding a nativize() routine to replace macify() and
fixpath() is useful.

ExtUtils::Install is a disaster.

Fix split_command() tests on Win32. (split_command() not broken, only tests)

Make MakeMaker a subclass of File::Spec.

Change File::Spec class method calls to object methods.

Copy eliminate_macros() and fixpath() from File::Spec::VMS and into MM_VMS.

Eliminate the above from inside FS::VMS->catfile and catdir.  Make into 
MM_VMS wrappers.
