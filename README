This is a CPAN distribution of the venerable MakeMaker module.  It is
currently in alpha release.  It's stable enough for personal use, but
do not install in a production environment.


Known Good:

Linux                   5.6.0, 5.6.1, 5.7.3
Tru64                   5.6.0, 5.7.3
OpenVMS                 5.6.1
Cygwin                  5.6.1
ActivePerl/Win32        5.6.1 build 631 with nmake


Known Problems:

PREFIX/LIB broken on Debian systems and many others.

ActivePerl likely broken if installed in C:\Program Files or other
prefix with a space in the name.

manifypods target produces command lines too long for some systems

Using the MMS utility on VMS causes lots of extra newlines.  Unknown
why this is so, might be a bug in MMS.  Problem not seen with MMK.
