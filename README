ExtUtils::MakeMaker is a standard module that comes with the perl
distribution. It writes Makefiles for perl extensions. It provides all
sorts of support to make development of extensions easy: building,
testing, installing, distributing and archiving extensions/modules.

To install this package, run

    perl Makefile.PL
    make install

There are no test scripts in this package, so you can skip the 'make'
command.

The very recent changes are documented in the Changes file.
