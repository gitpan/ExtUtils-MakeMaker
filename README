This is a CPAN distribution of the venerable MakeMaker module.  It is
currently in alpha release.  It's stable enough for personal use, but
do not install in a production environment.

OpenVMS                 5.6.1
Cygwin                  5.6.1
ActivePerl/Win32        5.6.1 build 631


Known Problems:

PREFIX/LIB broken on Debian systems.

ActivePerl likely broken if installed in C:\Program Files or other
prefix with a space in the name.

manifypods target produces command lines too long for some systems
