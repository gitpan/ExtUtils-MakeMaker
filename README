Known Good on Unix back to 5.6.0 except ExtUtils::Embed which is only
good back to 5.6.1.


Known Problems:

Debian
------

Due to a glitch in the layout of the Debian perl packages, Debian
users will have to either install the libperl-dev package (which
installs libperl.a and the symlink below) or add the symlink manually:

    cd /usr/lib/
    ln -s libperl.so.5.6.1 libperl.so

or else ExtUtils::Embed won't be able to find -lperl.

Debian is aware of the problem.


Win32
-----

Currently, ExtUtils::Installed isn't well.


VMS
---

Currently, ExtUtils::Installed and possibly ExtUtils::Manifest are not
well.
