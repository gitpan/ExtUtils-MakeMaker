Known Problems:

ActivePerl likely broken if installed in C:\Program Files or other
prefix with a space in the name.

manifypods target produces command lines too long for some systems

Using the MMS utility on VMS causes lots of extra newlines.  Unknown
why this is so, might be a bug in MMS.  Problem not seen with MMK.

ActivePerl/Win95 disttest produces "File creation error" from somewhere
in running Makefile.PL after check_manifest() is run.  Don't know why.
