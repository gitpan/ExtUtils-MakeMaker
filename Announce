MakeMaker 5.17 

mainly brings VMS in sync and adds a few minor enhancements like

    adding PREFIX to PASTHRU

    adding depend method to add arbitrary dependencies

    A replacement for 'touch' in perl that is able to set the
    timestamp of a file equal to another file

    A Liblist paragraph for DGUX

Most important for the perl distribution is the new file Mksymlists
that writes is dedicated to the symlist files needed by VMS, AIX and
OS/2. This should be added to perl's MANIFEST file.

For details see the Changes file.
